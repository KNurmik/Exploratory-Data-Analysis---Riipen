# Exploratory Data Analysis - Riipen
Riipen is a Vancouver-based company that connects students, educators and employers to cooperate on projects. 

Employers can apply to work with professors and vice versa by sending “requests”. Users were frustrated that their requests were not getting answered; they were often left with no response, so Riipen implemented a 14 day expiry limit for requests.

This analysis aims to answer the following questions: 
- How did the expiry feature affect response times? 
- Did this allow for more requests/connections between users? 
- Does the 14 day expiry limit make sense?
